# nino | v0.2.0 <br>Random Anime Image App for Discord

Discord bot that provides an easy way to get anime images and gifs randomly! This project stemmed from me testing how quickly I can get a new Discord app up and running using my [bot template](https://github.com/vexuas/djs-typescript-template). It was so fast (roughly just under a week) in fact that I added way more features out of scope of me initially only wanting to get waifus.

That being said, I had quite a bit of fun with this even if it just was a test run. There were a bunch of really cool anime projects out there when I was trying to look for APIs to retrieve the images. I couldn't settle for just one so I ended up using these 3 super cool and awesome APIs!

- [OtakuGifs](https://otakugifs.xyz) - High quality gifs in a huge collection to choose from. Pretty straighforward endpoints too
- [NekosAPI](https://nekos-api.vercel.app) - Diverse categories with so much metadata of images. Most advanced of the endpoints I've seen out of the 3, I see its v2 is trying to move to json-api specs so that's pretty neat.
- [Waifu.im](https://www.waifu.im) - Possibly the best waifu resource out there, just top tier waifu images all round and an easy-to-use interface. Great sus collections too if you're into that :shrug:
